This is a script that pushes all files in a local directory to an already created, remote repo. I'm still learning the ropes of git and github so this is experimental. This script must be located inside the directory of the desired local repo. It is self checking so that this git script isn't pushed along with the rest of the files in the folder but it is unstable. Whitespace in commit names seem to be cause it to be temperamental. One word named commits seem to be fine. Underscore naming works as well.
